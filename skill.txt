One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day

There's bllets flying through the
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
